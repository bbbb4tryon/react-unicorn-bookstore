          Yellow is the color of hope, of happiness, of the sun... which will
          eventually blow up and kill us all. Just like Jeff Bezos and Amazon.

          Our main competitor, who shall remain unnamed (but rhymes with
          Gudreeds), was purchased by Amazon as it expanded. Now someone who
          wants the perfect book to follow-up One Hundred Years of Solitude will
          not get a legitimate recommendation. People like their books to be
          different, even if you're still in the same genre. GoodReads says your
          next book should be the same book. Maybe the author changed, but
          everything else is exactly the same. Then when you're done with OHYoS,
          AmazonReads recommends more of Gabe's books. An you be like, 'yeh,
          more of the same'.... but here

          we have a better idea... three of the sameish qualites of a book,
          match with 3 of the sameish qualities of <em>another</em> book... and
          you get a recommendation based on the <strong>wildcard</strong> that
          changes your life forever.

          So instead of read-reading OHYoS, you see Good Night Moon matched with
          3 qualities and you get "The Little Prince" because the OHYoS and Moon
          are magically realistic, bildungsroman, that paint amazing landscapes in your head or real life... and the "Little Prince" has each of those qualities... but is also wild
